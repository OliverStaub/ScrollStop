# ScrollStop

This is a Safari Extension to help me stop Doomscrolling.

This Safari extension is adapted from the Chrome extension "Doomscroll Blocker" by Jason Zhang, originally licensed under the Apache License 2.0. The core doomscrolling detection and blocking logic is based on that original work.
