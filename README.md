# ScrollStop

This is a Safari Extension to help me stop Doomscrolling.

## How it Works

ScrollStop blocks doomscrolling on social media sites. When you scroll too far on a blocked site, the extension will show a warning and block access to the site for a set period.

## Credits

This Safari extension is adapted from the Chrome extension "Doomscroll Blocker" by Jason Zhang, originally licensed under the Apache License 2.0. The core doomscrolling detection and blocking logic is based on that original work.
